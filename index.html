          Lighthouse Labs was created in 2013 by a team of software developers
          with a passion for code, mentorship, and education. Our mission: to
          continuously find the best ways to train the next generation of
          developers and transform the way tech education is delivered. Five
          years later, we have introduced over 20,000 Canadians to the practice
          of coding and launched 1,000+ graduates into careers as professional
          developers. With the support of a brilliant team of instructors and
          mentors who view coding as the ultimate craft, we continue to empower
          students, launch careers, and contribute to the incredible growth of
          Canada's tech industry.

          experience and quality of education second to none. We love dogs,
          rubber ducks, gifs, and bake offs.
